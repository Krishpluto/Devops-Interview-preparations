Docker | Interview Questions With Answers

## 1. Docker Basics:

Question 1: What is Docker?
Answer: Docker is a platform for developing, shipping, and running applications in
containers. It allows developers to package an application with all of its
dependencies into a standardized unit for easy deployment.

Question 2: Explain the difference between Docker image and Docker container.
Answer: A Docker image is a lightweight, standalone, executable package that
includes everything needed to run a piece of software, including the code, runtime,
libraries, and dependencies. A Docker container is a runtime instance of a Docker
image.

Question 3: How does Docker achieve lightweight virtualization?
Answer: Docker uses containerization technology, which leverages features of the
Linux kernel (such as namespaces and cgroups) to create isolated environments
called containers. These containers share the host operating system's kernel but run
in separate user spaces, making them lightweight and efficient.

## 2. Docker Architecture:

Question 4: Explain the components of the Docker architecture.
Answer: The Docker architecture consists of the Docker Engine, Docker Images,
Docker Containers, Docker Registry, and Docker Compose. The Docker Engine is the
core component responsible for building and running Docker containers. Docker
Images are read-only templates used to create Docker containers. Docker Containers
are instances of Docker images that run applications. The Docker Registry is a
repository for Docker images, and Docker Compose is a tool for defining and
running multi-container Docker applications.

Question 5: What is Docker Engine?
Answer: Docker Engine is a client-server application with three major components: a
server, a REST API, and a command-line interface (CLI). The Docker Engine server is a
long-running process (daemon) that manages Docker containers and images on a
host system.

Question 6: How does Docker Networking work?
Answer: Docker Networking allows containers to communicate with each other and
with the outside world. Docker creates virtual networks that containers can be
attached to, enabling communication via IP addresses and ports. Docker also
supports various network drivers for different use cases, such as bridge, overlay, and
host networking.

## 3. Docker Commands:

Question 7: What are some common Docker commands?
Answer: Some common Docker commands include docker run (to run a
container), docker build (to build an image), docker pull (to pull an image from a
registry), docker push (to push an image to a registry), docker ps (to list running
containers), docker images (to list available images), docker stop (to stop a
container), and docker rm (to remove a container).

Question 8: Explain the difference between docker run and docker exec.
Answer: docker run is used to create and start a new container from an image,
while docker exec is used to execute commands inside a running container.

Question 9: How can you remove all Docker containers?
Answer: You can remove all Docker containers by running the command docker rm
$(docker ps -aq).

## 4. Dockerfile:

Question 10: What is a Dockerfile?
Answer: A Dockerfile is a text file that contains instructions for building a Docker
image. It specifies the base image to use, the commands to run during the build
process, and any configuration or metadata for the image.

Question 11: Explain the difference between CMD and ENTRYPOINT in a Dockerfile.
Answer: CMD is used to specify the default command to run when a container starts,
while ENTRYPOINT is used to specify the executable that will run when the container
starts. If both are present, ENTRYPOINT will be executed with CMD as its arguments.

Question 12: How can you pass arguments to a Dockerfile during the build process?
Answer: You can use build arguments in a Dockerfile by specifying them with
the ARG instruction and passing values to them using the --build-arg flag with
the docker build command.

## 5. Docker Networking:

Question 13: What is Docker bridge network?

containers connected to the same bridge network to communicate with each other
using IP addresses. It provides isolation and allows containers to access external
networks through NAT (Network Address Translation).

Question 14: How can you create a custom bridge network in Docker?
Answer: You can create a custom bridge network using the docker network
create command, specifying the --driver bridge option followed by the desired
network name.

Question 15: Explain Docker overlay network.
Answer: Docker overlay network facilitates communication between containers
across multiple Docker hosts. It uses VXLAN (Virtual Extensible LAN) technology to
create an overlay network that spans across hosts, enabling containers to
communicate seamlessly as if they were on the same host.

EXTRA: Docker networks are a feature of Docker that enable communication between Docker containers running on the same Docker host or across multiple Docker hosts. They provide isolated environments for containers to communicate with each other while keeping them secure from external interference. Here's an explanation of Docker networks and their use cases:

### Docker Networks:
1. **Default Bridge Network**:
   - When Docker is installed, it creates a default bridge network named `bridge`.
   - Containers connected to this network can communicate with each other by IP address.
   - Docker assigns IP addresses from a predefined range to containers in this network.

2. **User-Defined Bridge Networks**:
   - Docker allows creating custom bridge networks to facilitate communication between containers.
   - Users can define their own subnet and gateway for these networks.
   - Containers connected to user-defined bridge networks can communicate with each other by container name.

3. **Overlay Networks**:
   - Used for communication between Docker containers running on different Docker hosts.
   - Implements overlay networking using the VXLAN protocol, creating an overlay network spanning multiple Docker hosts.
   - Ideal for deploying containerized applications in a distributed environment, such as Docker Swarm or Kubernetes clusters.

4. **Macvlan Networks**:
   - Allows Docker containers to have their own MAC addresses and appear as physical devices on the network.
   - Useful for scenarios where containers need to communicate directly with physical devices or other non-Docker systems on the network.

5. **Host Networks**:
   - Containers attached to the host network share the network namespace with the Docker host.
   - They have direct access to the host's network interfaces and can communicate without any network isolation.
   - Often used when maximum network performance and compatibility are required, sacrificing some level of isolation.

### Use Cases:
1. **Microservices Architecture**:
   - Docker networks facilitate communication between microservices deployed as separate containers, enabling the development of scalable and modular applications.

2. **Multi-Tier Applications**:
   - Docker networks allow for the creation of separate network segments for front-end, back-end, and database containers, providing isolation and security.

3. **Container Orchestration**:
   - In container orchestration platforms like Kubernetes or Docker Swarm, Docker networks enable communication between containers across different nodes, ensuring seamless operation of distributed applications.

4. **Testing and Development**:
   - Docker networks simplify the setup of test environments where multiple containers need to communicate with each other, providing an isolated environment for testing and development.

5. **Service Discovery and Load Balancing**:
   - Docker networks support service discovery mechanisms and load balancing techniques, ensuring efficient communication between containers and distributing incoming traffic across multiple instances of a service.

Overall, Docker networks play a crucial role in enabling communication and connectivity between Docker containers, making them essential for building and deploying modern containerized applications.

## 6. Docker Volumes:

Question 16: What is a Docker volume?

directory, allowing the container to access files from the host system. Volumes, on
the other hand, are managed by Docker and provide persistent storage that can be
shared among containers and persists even if the container is removed.

## 7. Docker Compose:

Question 19: What is Docker Compose?
Answer: Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker
applications. It uses YAML files to configure the application's services, networks, and
volumes, making it easy to manage complex Docker setups.

Question 20: How do you define services in a Docker Compose file?
Answer: Services in a Docker Compose file are defined under the services section
using YAML syntax, where each service specifies its image, ports, environment
variables, volumes, and other configuration options.

Question 21: Explain the difference between docker-compose up and dockercompose start.
Answer: docker-compose up creates and starts containers for all services defined in
the Docker Compose file, while docker-compose start starts existing containers that
were previously created but stopped.
