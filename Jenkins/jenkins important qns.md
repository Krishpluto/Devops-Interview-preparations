1. **What and all Jenkins jobs have you written?**
   - I have written various types of Jenkins jobs, including freestyle projects, pipeline jobs (both scripted and declarative), multi-branch pipeline jobs, and parameterized jobs.

2. **Have you come across Jenkins files?**
   - Yes, Jenkinsfiles are a way to define Jenkins pipeline jobs as code. I have experience in writing and maintaining Jenkinsfiles for defining CI/CD pipelines.

3. **Create a pipeline job (Might be asked to write the syntax or a basic pipeline job depending on the input the interviewer gives)**
   - Sure, I can provide a basic example of a Jenkins pipeline job:
     ```groovy
     pipeline {
         agent any
         stages {
             stage('Build') {
                 steps {
                     // Insert build steps here
                     sh 'mvn clean package'
                 }
             }
             stage('Test') {
                 steps {
                     // Insert test steps here
                     sh 'mvn test'
                 }
             }
             stage('Deploy') {
                 steps {
                     // Insert deployment steps here
                     sh 'kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml'
                 }
             }
         }
     }
     ```

4. **Give me real-time scenario which you worked upon Jenkins pipeline job?**
   - One real-time scenario I worked on was setting up a CI/CD pipeline for a microservices-based application. The pipeline included building Docker images, running tests, pushing the images to a Docker registry, and deploying the services to a Kubernetes cluster.

5. **Have you written any multi-branch pipeline job? What is the advantage of having multi-branches over single branches?**
   - Yes, I have written multi-branch pipeline jobs. The advantage of multi-branch pipelines is that they automatically detect branches in source control repositories and create corresponding Jenkins jobs. This helps in managing multiple branches of code in a single pipeline, making it easier to maintain and scale CI/CD workflows.

6. **You install a plugin, do you reboot Master?**
   - No, installing a plugin in Jenkins does not require rebooting the master node. The changes take effect immediately after the plugin is installed.

7. **Multiple test cases to run at the same time parallel, how to write in declarative?**
   - In declarative pipelines, you can use the `parallel` directive to run multiple test cases in parallel. Here's an example:
     ```groovy
     pipeline {
         agent any
         stages {
             stage('Run Tests') {
                 steps {
                     parallel(
                         'Test1': { sh 'run_test1.sh' },
                         'Test2': { sh 'run_test2.sh' }
                     )
                 }
             }
         }
     }
     ```

8. **How nexus credentials are passed to Jenkins file to upload artifacts?**
   - Nexus credentials can be securely passed to the Jenkinsfile using Jenkins Credentials plugin. The credentials are stored in Jenkins Credentials store and then accessed in the Jenkinsfile using the `withCredentials` block.

9. **How are you managing your secrets in the Jenkins file?**
   - I manage secrets in Jenkins by using the Jenkins Credentials plugin to securely store and manage sensitive information such as passwords, API tokens, or SSH keys. These secrets are then accessed in the Jenkinsfile using the `withCredentials` block.

10. **Sonarqube setup and integration with Jenkins pipeline?**
    - To set up SonarQube with Jenkins pipeline, I install the SonarQube plugin in Jenkins and configure the SonarQube server URL and credentials. Then, I use the `withSonarQubeEnv` block in the Jenkins pipeline to execute SonarQube analysis and publish the results.

11. **How did you ensure wrong codes did not get into your pipeline?**
    - I ensure code quality by integrating static code analysis tools like SonarQube into the pipeline. If the code quality falls below a defined threshold, the pipeline fails, preventing the integration of poor-quality code. Additionally, automated testing at various stages ensures that only properly tested code progresses through the pipeline.

12. **Types of jobs in Jenkins?**
    - Jenkins supports various types of jobs, including:
      - Freestyle Project: Traditional Jenkins job with a straightforward configuration.
      - Pipeline: A suite of plugins that supports implementing and integrating continuous delivery pipelines.
      - Multi-Branch Pipeline: Automatically creates a set of pipelines based on branches in version control.
      - GitHub Organization: Discovers repositories and branches on GitHub and automatically creates jobs.
      - Maven Project: Manages Maven builds.

13. **How do you configure Maven in Jenkins?**
    - To configure Maven in Jenkins:
      1. Install the Maven Integration plugin.
      2. Configure Maven in the Jenkins Global Tool Configuration.
      3. In Jenkins job configuration, specify the Maven version and set up goals for the build.

14. **Have you configured SonarQube in Jenkins?**
    - Yes, I configure SonarQube in Jenkins by installing the SonarQube Scanner plugin, configuring the SonarQube server in Jenkins Global Tool Configuration, and then using the `withSonarQubeEnv` block in the Jenkinsfile for code analysis.

15. **Steps in Jenkins job, with syntax**
    - Jenkins jobs typically include stages like SCM checkout, build, test, deploy, and post-build actions. The syntax varies based on the job type. For example, in a pipeline job:
      ```groovy
      pipeline {
          agent any
          stages {
              stage('SCM Checkout') {
                  steps {
                      // SCM checkout steps
                  }
              }
              stage('Build') {
                  steps {
                      // Build steps
                  }
              }
              stage('Test') {
                  steps {
                      // Test steps
                  }
              }
              stage('Deploy') {
                  steps {
                      // Deployment steps
                  }
              }
          }
      }
      ```

16. **When you have a Jenkins job with a declarative pipeline, is it possible to merge the code with the master branch using Jenkins?**
    - Yes, you can use the `checkout` step in a declarative pipeline to pull code from a specific branch, make modifications, and then use the SCM plugin or Git command to merge the changes back to the master branch. However, it's recommended to follow a code review and merge process external to Jenkins for such operations.

17. **Explain the complete CICD process.**
    - The CI/CD process involves:
      - Continuous Integration (CI): Automatically integrating code changes into a shared repository, triggering automated builds and tests.
      - Continuous Delivery (CD): Automatically deploying code to an environment for further testing.
      - Continuous Deployment (CD): Automatically deploying code changes to production after passing all tests.
      - The process includes code quality checks, automated testing, deployment to staging, user acceptance testing, and deployment to production.

18. **What application have you built for the CICD of Java/JavaScript applications?**
    - I have implemented CI/CD for a microservices-based Java application where each service had its pipeline, including building Docker images, running tests, and deploying to a Kubernetes cluster. For JavaScript applications, I've set up pipelines for Node.js applications with npm builds, testing, and deployment.

19. **How do you enable continuous integration in Jenkins?**
    - Continuous integration in Jenkins is enabled by creating a Jenkins job (freestyle or pipeline) that triggers on code commits. This job typically includes steps for SCM checkout, building, and testing.

20. **How to run a shell command inside a stage?**
    - You can run shell commands inside a stage using the `sh` step in Jenkins pipeline syntax. Here's an example:
      ```groovy
      pipeline {
          agent any
          stages {
              stage('Example Stage') {
                  steps {
                      sh 'echo "Hello, world!"'
                      sh 'ls -l'
                      // Additional shell commands
                  }
              }
          }
      }
      ```

21. **After generating code quality reports, how do you get the report back to developers automatically from SonarQube in the Jenkins pipeline?**
    - After running SonarQube analysis in the Jenkins pipeline, you can use the `withSonarQubeEnv` block to access SonarQube environment variables, which contain the URL to the generated reports. You can then use these variables to publish reports or notify developers through email or other communication channels.

22. **How to get email notification whenever a stage fails?**
    - You can configure email notifications for failed stages in Jenkins using the `emailext` plugin. Within the Jenkins pipeline, use the `emailext` step to send an email notification when a stage fails. Here's an example:
      ```groovy
      pipeline {
          agent any
          stages {
              stage('Example Stage') {
                  steps {
                      // Stage steps
                  }
                  post {
                      failure {
                          emailext (
                              subject: "Pipeline Failed: ${currentBuild.fullDisplayName}",
                              body: "The Jenkins pipeline ${currentBuild.fullDisplayName} has failed.",
                              to: 'developer@example.com'
                          )
                      }
                  }
              }
          }
      }
      ```

23. **There are 10 stages in the pipeline, 4 stages are successfully completed, but the build fails in the 5th stage. Now you need to start the build from where the build process failed. How do you do that?**
    - Jenkins pipelines support resuming from a specific stage using the `input` step. You can add an `input` step after each stage, allowing manual intervention to continue the pipeline from that stage if necessary. Additionally, you can use the `catch` and `finally` blocks to handle failures and perform cleanup tasks before resuming the pipeline. Here's a basic example:
      ```groovy
      pipeline {
          agent any
          stages {
              stage('Stage 1') {
                  steps {
                      // Stage 1 steps
                  }
              }
              stage('Stage 2') {
                  steps {
                      // Stage 2 steps
                  }
              }
              stage('Stage 3') {
                  steps {
                      // Stage 3 steps
                  }
              }
              // Add an input step after each stage
              stage('Stage 4') {
                  steps {
                      // Stage 4 steps
                  }
                  post {
                      success {
                          input "Continue to Stage 5?"
                      }
                  }
              }
              stage('Stage 5') {
                  steps {
                      // Stage 5 steps
                  }
              }
              // Remaining stages
          }
      }
      ```
