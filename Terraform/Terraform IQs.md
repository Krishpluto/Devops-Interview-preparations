**1. What is Terraform, and how does it differ from other infrastructure as code tools?**
![alt text](/Terraform/images/image.png)
- Terraform is a open source infrastructure as code tool created by HashiCorp.
- It allows users to define and provision infrastructure using declarative configuration language.
- Unlike other tools, Terraform supports multiple cloud providers and on-premises infrastructure, offering a unified approach to manage diverse environments.

**2.Explain the concept of "declarative syntax" in Terraform and how it contributes to infrastructure management**
![alt text](/Terraform/images/image-1.png)
- *Declarative syntax* in Terraform means describing the desired state of infrastructure without specifying the step-by-step process to achieve it.
- Terraform interprets the configuration and determines the actions required to bring the actual state in line with the desired state, simplifying infrasturecture management.
